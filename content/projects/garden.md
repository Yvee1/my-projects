The idea of this project was to make a collection of all sorts of trees. I did not make as many trees as I wanted initially and it's all very simple, but it was still a fun exercise. Two sketches were made with p5.js, the binary tree with d3.js, and the minimal spanning tree was done with sigma.js.
