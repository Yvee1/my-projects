This is a collection of algorithmic botany sketches in the form of a website. I improved my HTML/CSS/JavaScript skills a bit, and also learned a little about templating and buildtools by working with gulp and nunjucks. I think I spent most of my time working on the tree on the homepage, it's calculated via the 3D space colonization algorithm and rendered with THREE.js. Apart from that, the leaf venation and L-system sketches are my favorites. I made use of a variety of JavaScript libaries: p5.js, THREE.js, pixi.js, pts.js, dat.gui.js.
