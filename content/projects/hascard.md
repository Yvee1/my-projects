Hascard is a minimal commandline utility for reviewing notes. 'Flashcards' can be written in markdown-like syntax. Check the [README](https://github.com/Yvee1/hascard#readme) for more info. I made this to improve my Haskell skills and also thought this would be somewhat useful to me if I managed to finish it. I did struggle a bit, especially the rendering of the open questions was a pain, but in the end I finished it and I am happy with how it turned out.
